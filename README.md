# Pyramidal Neuron module

Alex Sutton and Ted Brookings, Marder lab, Brandeis University

This module allows an XML file (created w/ Knossos, for example) to be converted to a format that the NEURON simulator can easily read and that we have analysis functions for. Please see the IPython Notebook "tutorial" for details on how to use this package.
