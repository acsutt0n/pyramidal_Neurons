# Pyramidal Neuron module

Alex Sutton and Ted Brookings, Marder lab, Brandeis University

## Tutorial

This module allows an XML file (created w/ Knossos, for example) to be converted to a format that the NEURON simulator can easily read and that we have analysis functions for. Please see the IPython Notebook "tutorial" for details on how to use this package.

## Dependencies

Almost everything is python and should be compatible with python 2.7 as well as 3.4+. If you download Anaconda (Continuum Analytics), it will probabaly include everything needed (maybe not NetworkX?).
